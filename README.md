# CHARITY CONNECT - CONNECTING ALL NGO'S
The aim of our project is to centralized the idea of donating to different NGO's based in different places.                   This website connects user who wants to donate to the nearby NGO's.

## Problem statement
 Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play a vital role in addressing various social, environmental, and humanitarian issues around the world. However, many NGOs face challenges in raising funds, reaching donors, and managing their resources effectively. There is no centralized platform that connects all NGOs and facilitates the process of donation for both donors and recipients. This leads to inefficiencies, duplication of efforts, lack of transparency, and reduced impact of NGO work.

## Relevance:
 Creating a centralized platform that connects all NGOs and streamlines the donation process would benefit both donors and recipients. Donors would be able to find NGOs that match their interests and preferences, donate easily and securely, track their donations‚Äô impact, and receive feedback from recipients. Recipients would be able to access more funding opportunities, showcase their work and achievements, communicate with donors directly, and receive guidance on best practices.

## Objectives:
 The main objective of this research is to design and develop a centralized platform that connects all NGOs and simplifies the donation process for both donors and recipients. The specific objectives are:

 * To conduct a needs assessment of NGOs and donors regarding their current challenges and expectations for a centralized platform.
 * To identify the features and functionalities that would make a centralized platform user-friendly, accessible, secure, transparent, and impactful.
 * To prototype and test a centralized platform with selected NGOs and donors using an agile development approach.
 * To evaluate the usability, satisfaction, adoption rate, effectiveness, efficiency ,and impact of the centralized platform on NGO work.
## ‚öôÔ∏èTech Stack

*   For developing this website we can use the MERN stack as our tech stack.The MERN stack is a JavaScript-based web development framework that stands for ***MongoDB***, ***Express.js***, ***React.js***, and ***Node.js***. These are the four key technologies that make up the MERN stack.
Using the MERN stack, we can develop a NGO centralized website that has the following features:

 * A responsive and user-friendly front-end that displays information about NGOs, their projects, their achievements, their needs, and their donors using React.js components.
 * A secure and scalable back-end that handles requests from the front-end using Express.js routes and middleware.
 * A RESTful API that communicates with MongoDB database using Node.js drivers to perform CRUD operations on data related to NGOs, donors, donations ,and feedbacks.
 * A cloud-based database that stores data in MongoDB Atlas clusters using MongoDB Atlas service.
